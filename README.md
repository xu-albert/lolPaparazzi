## How It Works

The bot monitors players and provides intelligent notifications:

- **Game Start**: When a player begins a ranked game (with role ping for subscribers)
- **Live Predictions**: Interactive prediction panel with team analysis, champion stats, and 4-minute prediction window
- **Post-Game**: Match results with champion artwork, KDA, CS, LP changes (wins only), and daily game count
- **Prediction Results**: Automatic accuracy updates and results notifications for all participants
- **Daily Summary**: Comprehensive report at midnight with games played, W/L record, LP delta, and champion stats

Daily tracking reduces spam while providing meaningful performance insights.

### Prediction System

- **Accuracy Tracking**: Personal prediction statistics isolated per tracked player and channel
- **Prediction Options**: Simple WIN or LOSS predictions on game outcomes
- **Flexible Predictions**: Users can change their predictions until the 4-minute deadline expires
- **Live Analysis**: Real-time team compositions with ranked winrates and champion-specific stats
- **Smart Timing**: 4-minute prediction window with Discord dynamic countdown timers
- **Streak Tracking**: Current and best prediction streaks for each user
- **Champion Insights**: Shows "First game on Champion!" for new picks with no ranked history
- **Deploy Resistant**: No duplicate prediction panels when bot restarts during games
- **Leaderboards**: Channel-specific rankings based on prediction accuracy
- **Statistics**: Win/loss prediction breakdowns and prediction history

// Session timeout (minutes of inactivity before session ends)
this.sessionTimeoutMinutes = 15;

// Polling intervals
this.normalPollingInterval = '*/3 * * * *'; // Every 3 minutes when idle
this.inGamePollingInterval = '*/5 * * * *'; // Every 5 minutes during sessions
```

Edit `src/riotApi.js` for different regions:
```javascript
// Change region endpoint
this.baseURL = 'https://na1.api.riotgames.com/lol'; // na1, euw1, kr, etc.

// Change regional cluster for Account API
this.accountBaseURL = 'https://americas.api.riotgames.com/riot/account/v1'; // americas, asia, europe
```

**Supported Regions:**
- **Americas**: na1, br1, la1, la2, oc1
- **Asia**: kr, jp1, tw2, th2, sg2, ph2, vn2

# Check application.commands scope was granted
```

**Database connection errors:**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL format
# Check database server status
# Ensure database exists and is accessible
```

**"Summoner not found" errors:**
```bash
# Verify Riot ID format: GameName#TAG
# Check region settings match summoner's region
# Ensure API key is valid and not expired
```

**Session tracking not working:**
```bash
# Check RIOT_API_KEY is valid
# Verify player is playing ranked solo/duo (queue ID 420)
# Check logs for API rate limit errors
```

### Logs & Debugging

**View logs:**
```bash
# Local development
npm run dev  # Shows real-time logs

# Production logs
pm2 logs lolpaparazzi  # If using PM2
docker logs lolpaparazzi  # If using Docker
```

**Common log messages:**
- `‚úÖ Database connection successful` - PostgreSQL connected
- `üìä Existing tracking records: X` - Data restored from database
- `üîÑ Restored tracking: Player in channel` - Session restored after restart
- `‚ö†Ô∏è DATABASE_URL not found` - Running without persistence

### Performance Optimization

**For high-traffic servers:**
1. Use production Riot API key
2. Implement Redis caching (optional)
3. Scale database resources
4. Monitor memory usage and optimize polling

**Database maintenance:**
```sql
-- Clean old session data (optional, run periodically)
DELETE FROM session_games WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
DELETE FROM session_stats WHERE updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```
